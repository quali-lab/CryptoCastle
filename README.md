# CryptoCastle — Upload-and-Done (No External Links)

What’s included:
- `index.html` (rewritten from your CryptoCastle.html)
- All `https://glassblade.co.uk/castle/...` links converted to local files
- Local placeholders created for every linked HTML page and asset (under `assets/...`)
- `.nojekyll` to prevent Jekyll quirks

## Publish (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a **public** repo (e.g., `cryptocastle`).
2. Click **Add file → Upload files** and **drag all files from inside this folder** (not the folder).
3. Click **Commit changes**.
4. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source → Deploy from a branch** → Branch: `main` • Folder: `/ (root)` → **Save**.
5. Open: `https://<your-username>.github.io/cryptocastle/`

## Edit later
- Replace any placeholder `.html` with your real content.
- Drop your real images/CSS/JS into the same `assets/...` paths (keeping filenames).
